NOTES 1.2 How to Use This Manual
This book is more than a manual. It combines a reference and notebook, 
collectively bringing together a comprehensive guide to the S-4 Sculpting 
Sampler.
Sections are laid out to cover the full workflow with walkthroughs, step by 
step guides and tips. Some pages carry a wide margin and some are 
intentionally blank enabling you to make your own notes.
Conventions used in this book.
(KNOB) Rounded parentheses represent the 9 endless rotary and push 
control knobs. Where necessary, the command action will be 
presented  and the actual parameter function named in uppercase 
text inside the parenthesis. The 8 knobs are mapped 1 - 4 top row 
left to right and 5 - 8 bottom row left to right. In practice the knob 
will represent the parameters as displayed on the screen and will 
be based on the mode selected.
The 9th knob is the single detented rotary encoder located upper 
left. This is named (SELECT) and is used for tempo, volume 
levels, system functions and to select through menu options.
Examples:
‘Turn (LENGTH)’ or ‘Turn (START)’
‘Press (SELECT)’.
[TRACK] Square parentheses contain functions that are selectable using 
one of the dedicated physical buttons. These are also labelled on 
the front panel with text labels or represented by a symbol for 
action and audio device buttons. Symbols may also be indicated 
in the text.
Note that action buttons are dynamic and will represent the 
function displayed on the screen above the button.
Examples:
‘Press [TRACK]’   or  ‘Press [MATERIAL]  ꀁ ’ 
‘Press [MOD 1], ꀆ  action button’   
[CTRL] + (KNOB) Button combinations are indicated with a ‘+’ between commands 
when used together. The ‘ctrl’ button is commonly used to select a 
secondary control function accessing additional options for 
example to change parameters in smaller increments. 
Examples:
‘Hold [CTRL] + Turn (KNOB 1)’

Parameters & Value Knobs
Select Knob
Action Buttons
Selected buttons will illuminate brightly 
when the function is selected. 
Each of the 8 push / rotary knobs represent 
the current display page parameters.
Any instruction will give the parameter name 
relevant to the knob, i.e. Turn (SPEED).
Holding a knob while adjusting some 
parameters will open a ‘mode select’ menu. 
These parameters are shown with a �’ tag.
The select knob is a tactile push / rotary encoder 
with detent rotation for iterative, precise changes. 
This selects from menus and options. By default 
this changes tempo 1 BPM increments.
The 4 Action buttons operate dynamically. 
Their function changes to represent the option 
currently displayed directly above the button. 
Some parameters operate on a single scale i.e. 0-
100%, some have a bipolar range ie -50 to +50 and 
others may be an option selection ie ‘Chromatic’
The selected function and its currently active 
page parameter values can be adjusted by 
the respective rotary knob. Pressing a page 
button repeatedly will cycle through is pages.
Sometimes the illuminated button and color 
represents its functions current state. The

A project exists at the highest level in the structure in which the 
elements of the S-4 are organised. This allows the entire collection of 
tracks and their components to be stored and managed. Global 
settings are managed and configured at project level. Next in the 
hierarchical structure is a track. A track is an audio function that 
contains a chain of 5 audio engine devices along with the 4 
modulation slots. All configurations for the track are set within the 
workflow of sound design. A track is a self contained audio 
environment where sounds can be created and developed. The S-4 
has 4 identical, parallel tracks, all of which operate in stereo end to 
end.This allows layering of tracks in order to develop more interesting 
sounds.  Tracks can also be routed into each other allowing the design 
of complex and intricate soundscapes and audio textures and 
expanding the creative experience further. A dedicated master mixer 
with level and pan controls operates at the final stage before the audio 
output.

NOTES
Audio can be routed using ‘sends’ from one track to another track. So the 
processed audio from the Material, Granular, Filter, Color and Space device 
chain along with any modulation is applied before being routing to mix into 
another tracks audio. This allows chaining of tracks and offers control of the 
incoming audio feedback level and the track send output amounts. If 
‘Sends Only’ is set as the Track input then only sent audio is used.
▌ CONFIGURING AUDIO SEND ROUTING FOR TRACKS
1. Open the track page. Press [TRACK].
2. Select a track using the action buttons. For example, Press [TRACK 2], 
ꀇ action button. The selected track will be the working track to edit.
3. Select and adjust the audio ‘Send’ levels. This is will direct a selected 
amount of the processed audio into another track. 
• Adjust the send option using the parameter knobs based on the 
action buttons. Audio can be sent to another track, for example 
adjust (SEND 3) to send the amount to Track 3.
• Audio can be sent to back into the same track, for example if Track 
2 is selected, adjust (SEND 2) to send the output amount back into 
to Track 2. This feedback can generate interesting effect chains.
• All track outputs are also by default  mixed fully at the master output 
stage accessed using [MIX].

The S-4 onboard memory has a common sample pool containing a 
collection of factory samples as well as any installed user samples. In 
particular the Material devices have a 6 min sample buffer and can access 
the libraries to select a sample source.
User samples can be copied, backed up and transferred in and out by 
connecting to a PC/Mac using the USB Mass Storage mode. An external 
USB drive can also be connected in order to access additional remote 
sample libraries.
The sample browser opens by selecting [LOAD], ꀆ Action button when a 
sample device such as Tape is open. A protected factory bank, organised 
by theme is pre-installed on the S-4.
Loading a sample with a filename containing ‘XXXBPM’ or ‘XXXbpm’ will 
automatically assign the ‘XXX’ value as the TEMPO parameter value. 
Note:
Sample format is .flac or .wav files, 8, 16, 24 or 32 bit. Files are internally converted to 
48kHz. Recorded files are stored in 48 kHz 24-bit stereo .wav format.

The S-4 is a sculpting sampler audio engine consists of 5 audio device 
slots chained in series. Each device slot can be configured by loading 
a device from the collection available and by setting and/or modulating 
its parameters. Material is the first device slot and the one which 
manages the audio source whether using a sample within the Tape 
device, a sample as a synth source in the Poly device or using the 
audio line inputs with the Bypass.The next slot is called Granular, and 
features Mosaic, a live granular processor with time-warping and 
pitch-shifting algorithms. The Filter slot houses a Ring device with a 
48-band, tuned filter bank with animation, tonal control and classic 
filter functionality. The penultimate device slot is Color. A Deform 
device with a collection of distortion based effects is available in this 
slot. The final device slot is Space, and its Vast device combines a 
reverb and delay. Routing the audio and parameter configuration of 
the audio chain is only a part of the sound design experience. Add 
modulation to any device parameter and the creative journey really 
opens up.

NOTES
About Granular Synthesis
Granular synthesis is based on the concept of taking an audio input or 
sample and dividing it into multiple, small segments. Instead of 
manipulating an oscillator, granular synthesis manipulates these tiny pieces 
of audio by spraying them into the audio field and adjusting the size and 
shape. Control over the breadth of parameters involved serves to create 
the output tone and sound with modulation adding more interest and 
movement to the sound.
Material device will manage and 
present the audio sample or input
A new sound will be generated and 
will output to the filter device
A sample can be divided into up to 
128 of miniature ‘grains’ per track. 
Grains can be sprayed into the audio

About Audio Filters
A filter operates across the audio frequency spectrum and is generally used 
to attenuate (sometimes boost) frequencies at points within the range. The 
audible frequency range is typically 20Hz to 20KHz and the pitch of each 
musical notes in a scale are tuned based on its a frequency. Filtering can 
affect the tone and texture of a sound for example cutting high frequencies 
gives focus to bass sounds while boosting in the mid to high range adds 
sparkle and brightness. The S-4 filter is designed for creativity and brings 
various sound design and modulation techniques into the play to create 
interesting and evolving sounds.

NOTES
Delay and Reverb are classic effects often paired together. A delay will 
create repeated audio taps and thicken sounds while adding musical 
rhythms and patterns. A reverb emulates the natural characteristics of how 
a sound behaves in a room or space, whether large or small.
▌ SETTING UP VAST
1. To adjust the amount of each effect applied to the audio chain, Turn 
(DELAY) and / or (REVERB).
2. To adjust the delay parameters, Turn (FEEDBACK) to adjust the 
amount of audio fed into the input. This creates echo and repeat style 
characteristics.
3. Turn (TIME) to set the timing of the delays, which can be set in note 
intervals if synchronised. Press & Turn (TIME) to choose the mode in 
which to set the time parameter. Options are ‘Straight’ for defined 
intervals or ‘Free’ to freely adjust.
4. To adjust the reverb parameters, Turn (SIZE) to adjust the 
expansiveness and room emulation. Vast is based on Hall style reverb. 
Turn (DECAY) to extend or shorten the reverb time.
5. Typically high frequencies need to be managed in reverb and delay 
based applications. To do so Turn (DAMP) to help control and tame the 
high frequencies using the low pass filter cutoff. 
6. There are a number of common spread macros that apply stereo 
characteristics for delay and reverb. Turn (SPREAD) where the setting 
value will apply the defined macro. Turn left 0-50% to adjust as a ping-
pong delay or right 50-100% to adjust the stereo diffusion.

Bypass Application: S-4 As an Effects Processor
Bypass is ideal for delivering a live audio stream to the granular, filter, color 
and space audio chain for processing.  The chain then performs as an 
effect module rather than using its internal audio. On the fly processing can 
add a new twist to live performances and improvisation sessions and add a 
new dimension to other audio gear.

Modulation is a core element for getting the best from the S-4 
Sculpting Sampler. Animate and bring life to any parameter using the 
rich and unique modulation system. Each track has four configurable 
modulators that can be mapped to any parameter with almost 
unlimited mapping destinations. Choose between a range of different 
modulators from complex LFOs, and generative sequencers to 
envelopes. Modulation is the process of influencing or changing the 
value of a parameter from another control source. Taking this concept 
further, automatically modulating a parameter value using another 
control parameter can expand the creative options enormously. The 
S4 takes these concepts to advanced stages opening up organic 
sound designs and evolving creative landscapes and more. Layering 
modulation to a variety of destinations or using a combination of 
modulators to a single destination makes the modulation range of 
options almost endless. The creative journey is an exciting one with 
experimentation, trials and exploration a fundamental part of the 
sound design and music making process when working with S-4.

NOTES 4.2.1 Wave - Modulator
An LFO or Low Frequency Oscillator is a wave which cycles continuously at 
a defined rate. An LFO operates slower than an audio level oscillator and is 
used for modulation. The Wave modulator is a classic LFO with warping 
and morphing features to create complex and interesting shapes.

Modulators4
Random operates either as a randomly generated ‘fixed’ shape or a 
continuously changing random shape. This is ideal for generative and 
evolving sounds.
A loop cycle can consist of between 1-32 steps in length, each step 
duration set by rate. If the ‘Sync’ is ON, the modulator automatically 
resynchronises to the global timeline when length or rate is changed to 
maintain the quantisation of the 1st beat.  If Sync is OFF the sequence runs 
freely with no reset when changing rate or length.
New random variations can be generated on each loop where each step 
level is adjusted iteratively. The amount of randomisation set by the 
variation parameter. Variation at 0% will set a fixed random shape cycle.

NOTES
Modulators4
An envelope is used for notes or beats to establish its contour over time, 
often as a one shot for example when pressing a note key. The S-4 ADSR 
is a traditional envelope but with extra features.
The ADSR modulator also allows the curve of the three Attack, Decay and 
Release time based elements of the envelope to be adjusted. This adds an 
extra level of sound shaping control.
Spread duplicates the envelope and creates a stereo-like effect based on 
the phase difference adjusted between the two envelopes.
Triggering the Envelope
There are two ways to trigger the envelope:
1. By pressing the [TRIG], ꀉ Action button.
2. From an incoming MIDI Note on the tracks MIDI Channel.
In both cases a trigger will initiate the Attack stage and the ADSR release 
stage will commence when the trigger is lifted.

Managing and capturing audio into the S-4 can be an important option 
as part of the sound design process, as interfacing with other audio 
gear expands the creative possibilities. The S-4 offers multiple 
interface options for audio. One option is to use the ‘In 1’ and ‘In 2’ line 
inputs by connecting to the rear panel. In addition an internal 
microphone offers a quick and easy way to capture surrounding audio 
immediately on the fly. Also an external headset can be used which 
has integrated headphones and microphone. This would need to have 
a 4-Pole TRRS 3.5mm Mini Jack and be connected to the Headphone 
jack. The USB interface also provides audio functionality and connects 
both as a host or as a device. Interfacing to a PC / Mac Digital Audio 
Workstation can be performed directly across the USB audio function 
where 10 Inputs and 10 Outputs are presented. This covers all 4 
stereo tracks in the S-4 along with the master out stereo signal. The 
S-4 operates at 24-bit / 48 kHz stereo audio in and out and will 
recognise .wav and .flac sample formats. Samples can be stored on 
board the 4GB memory. In addition the S-4 can also operate with an 
external USB drive when connected to access user samples.

MIDI or Musical Instrument Digital Interface is a standard protocol for 
communicating between audio devices.  The S-4 can communicate 
MIDI across the dedicated MIDI in and out ports and also using the 
USB-C connection. Each of the 4 tracks can be controlled on 
individually dedicated MIDI Channels. The MIDI In and Out uses a 
TRS Type A, 3.5mm Jack to MIDI DIN adapter. An adapter is supplied 
with the S-4. MIDI allows the S-4 to be played by notes from an 
external MIDI Keyboard or from an external sequencer. In addition to 
the digital interface of MIDI, two analog connections also exist. The 
Sync In and Out will be available in a future update for connecting to 
analog gear and to / from Eurorack modules. 
MIDI Sync and Analog Sync Functions are not included in release 1.0 
of the S-4 Firmware. They will be implemented in the first update 
coming soon. MIDI Channels and CC can be assigned.

NOTES
▌ SETTING UP MIDI SYNC FOR EXTERNAL GEAR 
1. Ensure S-4 is connected to another MIDI device and the MIDI channels 
are aligned to the same.
2. Decide on which device will be the primary lead and which will be a 
secondary follower.
3. Use the action button navigation or the (SELECT) Knob to scroll to the 
desired option to change. To toggle the option On / Checked or Off / 
Unchecked turn any of the 8 parameter knobs or tap [SELECT].
• CC CONTROL : On / Off. When On the S-4 will receive external CC 
messages in order to control defined parameters.
• SYNC IN : On / Off. When On an external device can be used to 
control the clock. The S-4 and its global tempo will respond to the 
timing of the external clock. Manual tempo adjustments using the 
(SELECT) knob will be ignored when Sync In is On and will be 
available when Sync In is Off.
• SYNC OUT : On / Off. When On an external device will respond to 
the S-4 clock. The S-4 global tempo will be used by the external 
device. Manual tempo adjustments using the (SELECT) knob will be 
available when Sync In is Off and and external clock is used when 
Sync In is On.
• START / STOP : On - The S-4 recognises and acts upon the 
incoming start / stop commands from the connected MIDI Device 
sending transport. This will control the Play/Stop tracks button. 
When off the S-4 Transport will be independently controlled by the 
Play/Stop button.

NOTES 7.4 MIDI CC
MIDI Continuous Control Change Messages, also shortened to CC, are 
used in the S-4 to control parameters from external gear. CC Messages are 
mapped using a specific CC number. Parameter changes are then 
communicated over a value range of 0-127 which then affects the 
destination parameter value based on its own designated range. Typically 
an external MIDI controller knob or fader will control the S-4 parameter.

7.5 Sync In / Out
The S-4 can be synchronised with an external analog clock. The S-4 can 
send or receive an analog clock at 24 PPQN using the rear Sync In and 
Sync Out connections. If multiple clocks are connected to S-4 the hierarchy 
dictates the primary lead clock used where the Sync In Analog clock is the 
highest in the order.
Pam’s New Workout synchronised as the secondary follower to S-4 which is  the 
primary clock. Any subsequent connected devices to PNW will be synchronised. An 
output from PAM’s could be used to synchronise the S-4 using it’s Sync In as an 
option if the Eurorack is to operate as the primary clock.

This section covers all the elements of a non-creative nature and  
things that don't fit a sound design workflow. System based functions 
such as firmware updates and configuration settings are contained 
here along with housekeeping guidance. Some elements in the 
configuration settings are also covered in the appropriate section 
along with the relevant topic earlier in this manual. You could consider 
this the area for all the boring bits, but nevertheless there is is still 
useful and in fact important information contained within. As such it is 
worth at least familiarising with this section and its contents.

It is possible to connect and communicate with the S-4 from a PC/Mac 
using the USB-C connection. This is useful for a variety of reasons but one 
specific function is to transfer data to the S-4 as a remote storage device. 
Transferring samples and firmware updates can be performed in this mode.
▌ CONNECTING A PC/MAC
1. Ensure the S-4 is powered off.
2. Connect a compatible USB cable between the PC / Mac and the S-4 
USB-C connector. The cable will depend on the PC/Mac connections 
i.e. Type C or A etc. Ensure this is a fully functional USB data 
compatible cable and not designed only for use as a power cable.
3. Power ON the S-4 using the supplied PSU. This will need the dedicated 
PSU connected as the USB port does not power the S-4 device.

NOTES 8.8 Power Considerations
The S-4 is powered from a dedicated power supply and is not in itself 
powered by the USB port. Portable power chargers can be used and also 
the S-4 can power other devices from its USB port. It is impossible to give 
details for each connected device but there are some generic elements to 
consider.
• S4 stand alone power and general consumption:  1A, 12V (12 Watt)
• S4 powering a connected Torso Electronics T-1: 1.2A, 12V (14.4 Watt)
• S4 + max current draw from USB port: 1.5A, 12V (18 Watt)
• The current limit for powering external devices via S-4’s USB is 1A, 5V.
