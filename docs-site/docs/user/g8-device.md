# G8 Device (Trance Gate)

G8 is a 64-step rhythm sequencer and volume gate (trance gate) that creates rhythmic patterns by modulating the volume of the signal over time.

## Controls

- **Rate**: Sets the speed of the gate sequencer relative to the project tempo.
  - Options: **1**, **1/2**, **1/4**, **1/8**, **1/16** (quantized divisions).
- **Step Sliders**: 64 individual vertical sliders representing each step in the sequence.
  - **100%**: The signal passes through at full volume.
  - **0%**: The signal is completely muted (silence).
  - **Intermediate values**: Allows for rhythmic volume "ghosting" or partial gating.
- **On / Bypass**: Toggles the gate effect on or off.

## Usage Tips

- Use the G8 device at the end of a chain (or after a long reverb) to create sharp, rhythmic "chopped" textures.
- Lowering the sliders for certain steps while keeping others at 100% creates classic trance-style gating.
- Experiment with different **Rate** settings to change the rhythmic feel from slow pulses to rapid-fire stuttering.
