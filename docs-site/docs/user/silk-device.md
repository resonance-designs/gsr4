# Silk Device

The Silk device is a resonator and filter bank used for shaping the harmonic content and adding movement to your tracks.

## Controls

### Primary Filter
- **Wet**: Dry/wet mix of the processed signal.
- **Cutoff**: Main filter cutoff frequency.
- **Res (Resonance)**: Resonance depth of the filter.
- **Pitch**: Sets the fundamental frequency of the resonator.
- **Tone**: Adjusts the harmonic brightness.
- **Tilt**: Bipolar EQ tilt for shifting the balance between low and high frequencies.
- **Slope**: Controls the steepness of the filter or resonator response.

### Envelope & Modulation
- **Decay**: Controls the fade-out time of the resonator.
- **Dec Mode (Decay Mode)**:
  - **Sustain**: The sound sustains while triggered.
  - **Choke**: The sound is gated or choked based on the decay setting.
- **Detune**: Randomizes or spreads the internal frequencies for a thicker sound.

### Animation (LFOs)
- **Waves**: Amount of periodic modulation applied to the filter.
- **W-Rate**: Frequency/rate of the wave modulation.
- **Noise**: Amount of random (noise-based) modulation.
- **N-Rate**: Frequency/rate of the noise modulation.

## Routing
- **Pre / Post**: Toggles whether the device is placed before or after other elements in the chain (specifically relative to the granulator in some engines).
