# Texture Device

The Texture device provides a suite of saturation, compression, and lo-fi degradation tools to add character and "grit" to your sound.

## Controls

### Saturation & Dynamics
- **Drive**: Adds harmonic saturation and overdrive.
- **Compress**: A simple one-knob compressor for thickening the sound and controlling peaks.
- **Crush**: Bit-crushing and sample rate reduction for digital lo-fi artifacts.
- **Tilt**: Dual-band tilt EQ to shift the tonal balance.

### Noise Generation
- **Noise**: Adds a layer of generated noise to the signal.
- **Noise Decay**: Controls the envelope decay of the added noise.
- **Noise Color**: Adjusts the spectral color (band-pass cutoff) of the noise.
- **Gate**: Toggles a noise gate to clamp the noise when no signal is present.

### Mix & Output
- **Wet**: Dry/wet mix of the entire texture chain.
- **Post Gain**: Final output gain for the device, useful for compensating for volume changes from drive or compression.

## Usage Tips

- Use small amounts of **Drive** and **Compress** to "glue" tracks together.
- The **Crush** control is excellent for giving clean samples a vintage sampler or lo-fi aesthetic.
- Combine **Noise** with the **Gate** for "vinyl-style" crackle that only appears when audio is playing.
