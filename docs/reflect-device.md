# Reflect Device

The Reflect device is the final spatial processor in the track chain, providing high-quality delay and algorithmic reverb.

## Reverb Controls
- **Reverb**: Dry/wet mix of the reverb processor.
- **Size**: Adjusts the simulated room or space dimensions.
- **Spread**: Increases the stereo width of the reverb tail.
- **Damp**: A low-pass filter to dampen high frequencies in the reverb, simulating softer surfaces.
- **Decay**: Controls the length of the reverb tail (T60).

## Delay Controls
- **Delay**: Dry/wet mix of the delay processor.
- **Time**: Sets the delay time.
- **Feedback**: Controls how much of the delayed signal is fed back into the input, determining the number of repeats.
- **Time Mode**:
  - **Straight**: BPM-synced divisions (1/4, 1/8, etc.).
  - **Dotted**: Dotted BPM-synced divisions.
  - **Triplet**: Triplet BPM-synced divisions.
  - **Free**: Manual time control in milliseconds (approx. 2.7ms to 10s).

## Actions
- **Clear**: Immediately clears the delay and reverb buffers.
- **Freeze**: Toggles a freeze mode that holds the current sound in the delay/reverb buffers indefinitely, creating a sustaining pad.

## Output
- **Post Gain**: Final output gain for the device to balance levels after spatial processing.
