# TLBX-1 End User Guide

This space is reserved for end-user walkthroughs of the UI. Add more docs here to cover workflows and controls.

## Suggested Sections

- Loading samples and managing tracks
- Tape-Deck controls and loop behavior
- Granulator bypass and granular behavior
- Modul8 8‑LFO modulation device for engine + downstream parameters, with per‑LFO Amount + Bias (center)
- Exporting and saving projects

## Latest Changes

- Granulator DSP mapping is active with parameter smoothing and BPM‑synced rate divisions on the Rate control from 0–50%.
- G8 trance gate device added to the downstream chain (after Silk).
- Tape-Deck engine supports experimental video loading (audio still drives playback).
- Modul8 LFOs run when transport is playing and restore base values when targets are cleared.
- Void Seed adds Moog filter + drive with pre/post toggle, Close Decay, and stereo width control.
- FMMI engine added with global FM controls, step locks, randomize/clear/copy-paste utilities, and per-parameter randomization masks.
- Void Seed and FMMI can feed the full downstream device chain (Granulator, Silk, Modul8, G8, Texture, Reflect).
